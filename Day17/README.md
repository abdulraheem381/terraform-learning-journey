### ðŸ“Œ Day 17 â€“ IAM User & Role Management with Terraform

Today I worked on a complete **IAM User & Role Management Project** using Terraform.

âœ… Created IAM users from a YAML file.
âœ… Assigned roles (admin, developer, readonly, auditor).
âœ… Attached AWS managed policies to roles.
âœ… Generated login profiles and passwords.
âœ… Followed clean code practice by splitting into multiple files.
