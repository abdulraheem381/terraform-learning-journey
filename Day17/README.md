Today I built a complete **IAM User & Role Management Project** using Terraform.

* ✅ Created IAM users from a YAML file
* ✅ Assigned roles (admin, developer, readonly, auditor)
* ✅ Attached AWS managed policies to roles
* ✅ Generated login profiles and passwords
* ✅ Followed clean code practice by splitting into multiple files
